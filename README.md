# project_shop_react

I created an E-commerce application inspired by Apple. 

Run npm/yarn install the dependencies

Also run npm (install) / yarn (add) these libraries:

⇤ install or add firebase

⇤ install or add react-router-dom

⇤ install or add react-icons-kit

⇤ install or add react-firebase-hooks

To run the app: yarn dev


### Environment for development
⇤ Visual Studio Code for coding

⇤ GitHub Desktop for push, commit, and pull to GitHub

### Tools that are used in this project
In this project, I use ReactJs, a JavaScript library for front-end and back-end.
I also use Firebase especially for storing images and database (Firestore).

### Deploy the application
I use Vercel to deploy my application, https://project-ecommerce-ofnfi33z8-ericaan.vercel.app/

I had to create a new repository in GitHub because my previous repository have a problem in building process (deployment in Vercel)

I also have to set the environment in Vercel (Firebase config) and add domain to Firebase for my vercel domain.
